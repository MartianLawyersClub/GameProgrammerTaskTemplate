This is the repo for the MLC Game Programmer Task, which involves extending an example seed chess game with procedural content to carry out piece captures based on context provided to the LLM. The task also includes designing and implementing clear and self-explanatory UI/UX for the new mechanics, presenting relevant outcomes to the player, establishing the necessary pipelines, and documenting the implementation process and findings.
